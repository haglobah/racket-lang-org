Racket version 8.9 is now available from [https://download.racket-lang.org/](https://download.racket-lang.org/)

## As of this release:

* The HtDP student languages come with checked signatures. Programmers
  can express signatures in a formal notation, and these signatures are
  checked at run-time (in a performance-neutral manner). The addition of
  this formal language associates meaning with several names that had no
  meaning before. — This feature is experimental, and we may amend or
  retract it later. (cf.
  [https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/beginner-abbr.html?q=signatures#%28part._beginner-abbr-signatures%29](https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/beginner-abbr.html?q=signatures#%28part._beginner-abbr-signatures%29))

* Switching into and out of dark mode is handled better on Mac OS and
  Linux.

* Racket uses Unicode 15.0 for character and string operations.

* The `racket/hash-code` library provides support for combining hash
  codes. (cf. [https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Equality.html#%28mod-path._racket%2Fhash-code%29](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Equality.html#%28mod-path._racket%2Fhash-code%29))

* A language module can have a `configure-expand` submodule that is
  dynamically required to configure a parameterization before expansion
  of another module. (cf. [https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/running-sa.html#%28part._configure-expand%29](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/running-sa.html#%28part._configure-expand%29))

* `stream-cons` supports multiple values. (cf. [https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/streams.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fstream..rkt%29._stream-cons%29%29](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/streams.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fstream..rkt%29._stream-cons%29%29))

* `unit/c` subcontracts may depend on bindings from any imported or
  exported signature. Additionally, bindings’ contracts are enforced
  within subcontracts, and violations blame the contract itself (like
  `->i`). (cf. [https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/unitcontracts.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Funit..rkt%29._unit%2Fc%29%29](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/unitcontracts.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Funit..rkt%29._unit%2Fc%29%29))

* `racket/class` provides the `dynamic-instantiate` procedure for
  instantiating a class with a dynamic list of by-name initialization
  arguments. (cf. [https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/objcreation.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fclass-internal..rkt%29._dynamic-instantiate%29%29](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/objcreation.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fclass-internal..rkt%29._dynamic-instantiate%29%29))

* TCP output block buffering implies TCP_NODELAY. (cf. [https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/tcp.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Ftcp..rkt%29._tcp-connect%29%29](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/tcp.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Ftcp..rkt%29._tcp-connect%29%29))

* Submodules and Check Syntax require arrows work better together.

* Typed Racket's shallow check generation is improved.

* Many other improvements and bug fixes are included!
